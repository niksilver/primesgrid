# Primes Grid

Coding exercise to create a multiplication table of prime numbers. Requires user input and console output.

## What I'm pleased with

* The I/O is (mostly) externalised.
* It's fairly minimal code.

## If I had more time...

* I'd inject the print function to as well at the readLine function.
* I'd tidy up Grid.asText, which has too much functionality in the yield clause.
